Module 9 - SQL challenge

2024-02-24 

All code was written by myself, Ryan MacFarlane.  No tutor or classmate collaboration this week.

Please note - the script file is in the main 'EmployeeSQL' folder - titled 'Module_9_challenge_employees_db_SQL_Script_202402.sql'
Table Schema is included at the beginning of the script - this is also the code I used to create the tables in PGAdmin4, using
Postgres SQL.  A *.png file of the picture is also included in the 'Resources' folder.  This was created using QuickDBD - website -
https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/.  Database I created was called 'employee_db'.

If you have any questions, or any trouble accessing anything - please reach out to me at atlis34@yahoo.com.

Thank you for reading/grading!
